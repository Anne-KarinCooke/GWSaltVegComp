Seepage, why is seepage different from drainage/capillary upflow? Looks like you are doing this twice?
Profile is not free draining.
At high rainfall, there is surplus water as Salvucci equation cannot drain fast enough
Where is seepage going? To runoff or to drainage? Seems to go runoff, so saturation excess runoff

The soil moisture balance now in mm? Has this been corrected for Svir?

Plant water uptake is this actually in mm? Related to M, so maybe this bring mm?
Nope, divided: M/(M+k1) so ratio. therefore units gmax*P should be mm!!
P is in g/m2 so gmax needs to be mm*m2/g: indeed: Saco & Moreno (2013): mm g-1 m2 d-1
This is related to plant biomass, need to check this against Saco & Moreno las Heras

Conversion salt mass to salt concentration?
kg salt/(mm3/mm3) = mm3*kg/mm3 how do we get to mg/L? 
Salt mass is divided by mm depth: mass/length

Analysis of parameters, are these all correct?
This is way too high. Salt concentration in rainfall is in the order of 1 mg/L
# salt concentration in rainfall
ConcConst <-  0.01 #g/L

Again this is far too high, 3000 mg/L, which is 4500 uS/cm.
Maybe that is OK, but not for shallow groundwater? 
If we assume 800 uS/cm this should be 500 mg/L or 0.5 g/L 
# groundwater salt concentration
CMgw <- 3.0 #g/L 

Is this reasonable? The carrying capacity might be high: 50 g/m2??
# ecosystem carrying capacity, [g/m2]
P0 <-  500.0
